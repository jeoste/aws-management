# React and shadcn/ui Configuration

This project uses React with shadcn/ui for interface components, specifically checkboxes in the Diagram section.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

For development with hot-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch Vite in development mode. Note that you may need to configure a proxy or modify Flask configuration to serve React files in development.

## Production Build

Before launching Flask, you must build React components:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate compiled files in `static/react/`.

## Structure

- `src/` : React/TypeScript source code
- `src/components/ui/` : shadcn/ui components (checkbox, label, etc.)
- `src/components/` : Custom React components
- `static/react/` : Compiled files (generated by build)
- `tailwind.config.js` : Tailwind CSS configuration (used by shadcn/ui)
- `components.json` : shadcn/ui configuration

## Notes

- Tailwind CSS is now managed via npm (not CDN)
- Styles are defined in `src/index.css`
- React components communicate with vanilla JS via `window.mountDiagramCheckboxes`
